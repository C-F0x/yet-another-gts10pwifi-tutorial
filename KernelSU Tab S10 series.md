# Method A

1. Get YuzakiKokuban-Resized.img from [Releases](https://github.com/C-F0x/yet-another-gts10pwifi-tutorial/releases/tag/ImageHub)

2. Rename it to boot.img than flash it via [fastbootd](https://github.com/C-F0x/yet-another-gts10pwifi-tutorial/releases/tag/fastbootD_only). Or you can flash it in Odin, remember to compress it to boot.tar at first.

3. Boot, than use KernelSU or its fork to patch the init_boot.img, you can get it from AP.tar.md5 or the [releases](https://github.com/C-F0x/yet-another-gts10pwifi-tutorial/releases/tag/ImageHub).

4. Flash patched_init_boot.img again via fastbootd or odin.

Q: Will it lose userdata

A: You will lose your userdata only if u moddified vbmeta.img, it's not necessary on OneUI 6.1/7. 

But Unforntunately, it seems to be necessary on OneUI 8 cuz u need to use oneui7 bl with oneui8 ap cp csc. SadlyðŸ˜ž

Once system booted with a different vbmeta, userdata got broken so that u need to factoryformat. e.g dont modify vbmeta after sys update
